##Graphify

Graphify is a data visualization web app that allows users to easily upload and save datasets as well as creating and sharing customizable charts, additionally it allows users to search and visualize from more than 10,000 datasets.

Upload your own data or search it from public datasets

Graphify allows users to upload and save their own datasets, and immediately begins to explore different ways of displaying them. For managing the storage of datasets, we use AWS. Users can also search public datasets via Socrata Open Data API. 

Display graphs based on users' selected data

Once users select data, Graphify automatically creates previews with all available charts. If users are not sure what would be the best graph to represent their data, Graphify also gives a recommendation based on users' selecting data.

Edit, share and clone graphs in real time

Users not only could customize graphs in their specifications, like title, names of X and Y axes, legend, colors, etc, but also could share their graphs through an unique link, embed them as SVG file and download them as an image. Users could make a clone of a selected graph,save in their profile any changes they make.
